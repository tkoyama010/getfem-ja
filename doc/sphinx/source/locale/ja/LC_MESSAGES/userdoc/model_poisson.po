"The following example is a part of the test program "
":file:`tests/laplacian_with_bricks.cc`. Construction of the mesh and "
"finite element methods are omitted. It is assumed that a mesh is build "
"and two finite element methods ``mf_u`` and ``mf_rhs`` are build on this "
"mesh. Is is also assumed that ``NEUMANN_BOUNDARY_NUM`` and "
"``DIRICHLET_BOUNDARY_NUM`` are two valid boundary indices on that mesh. "
"The code begins by the definition of three functions which are "
"interpolated on ``mf_rhs`` in order to build the data for the source "
"term, the Neumann condition and the Dirichlet condition. Follows the "
"declaration of the model object, the addition of the bricks and the "
"solving of the problem::"
