"where :math:`a` is the coefficient and :math:`u` the variable. The "
"coefficient can be a scalar, a matrix or an order four tensor. The "
"variable can be vector valued or not. This means that the brick treats "
"several different situations. If the coefficient is a scalar or a matrix "
"and the variable is vector valued then the term is added componentwise. "
"An order four tensor coefficient is allowed for vector valued variable "
"only.  The coefficient can be constant or described on a FEM. Of course, "
"when the coefficient is a tensor described on a finite element method (a "
"tensor field) the corresponding data can be a huge vector. The components"
" of the matrix/tensor have to be stored with the fortran order "
"(columnwise) in the data vector corresponding to the coefficient "
"(compatibility with BLAS). The symmetry and coercivity of the given "
"matrix/tensor is not verified (but assumed)."

"that adds an elliptic term relatively to the variable ``varname`` of the "

"This corresponds to the Laplace operator. ``mim`` is the integration "

"region number. If it is omitted, it is assumed that the term will be "
"computed on the whole mesh. The result of the function is the brick index"
