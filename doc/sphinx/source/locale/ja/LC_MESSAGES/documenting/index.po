"The GetFEM++ library has a substantial body of documentation, much of it "
"contributed by various authors. The markup used for the GetFEM++ "
"documentation is `reStructuredText`_, developed by the `docutils`_ "
"project, amended by custom directives and using a toolset named `Sphinx`_"
" to postprocess the HTML output."

"If you're interested in contributing to GetFEM++'s documentation, there's"
" no need to write reStructuredText if you're not so inclined; plain text "
"contributions are more than welcome as well. The main documentations are "
"in the directory ``doc/sphinx/source`` of the project. A part of the "
"documentation is automatic and comes from the sources of the project. "
"This is in particular the case for the documentations of the interface "
"commands which are located in the ``interface/src/gf_*.cc`` files."
