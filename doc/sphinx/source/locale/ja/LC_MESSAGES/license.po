"GetFEM was born during the PhD thesis of Yves Renard (1994-1998, the "
"first files dating from 1995). The fondamental bases of GetFEM (assembly "
"in any dimension, separation of geometric transformations, finite element"
" methods and cubature methods) date from 1999. However, GetFEM did not "
"take the size it is now without the contributions of Julien Pommier since"
" 2001. His major contributions are generic assembly, Matlab and Python "
"interfaces and the graphical postprocessing (including nice Matlab "
"functions, vtk, open DX output, slices ...). Early versions distributed "
"in 2002 already contain these components. Since then, GetFEM grows thanks"
" to various collaborations and external contributions."
