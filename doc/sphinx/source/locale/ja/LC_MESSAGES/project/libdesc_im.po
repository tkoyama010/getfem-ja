"The CUBATURE module gives access to the numerical integration methods on "
"reference elements. In fact it does not only contain some cubature "
"formulas because it also give access to some exact integration methods. "
"However, the exact integration methods are only usable for polynomial "
"element and affine geometric transformations. This explain why exact "
"integration methods are not widely used. The description of cubature "
"formulas is done either directly in the file :file:`getfem_integration.h`"
" or via a description file in the directory ``cubature`` of |gf|. The "
"addition of new cubature formulas is then very simple, it suffices to "
"reference the element on which it is defined and the list of Gauss points"
" in a file and add it to this directory. Additionally, In order to "
"integrate terms defined on a boundary of a domain, the description should"
" also contains the reference to a method of same order on each face of "
"the element."
