"The Fem module is the part of |gf| which describes the finite elements at"
" the element level and the degrees of freedom. Finite element methods can"
" be of different types. They could be scalar or vectorial, polynomial, "
"piecewise polynomial or non-polynomial, equivalent via the geometric "
"transformation or not. Moreover, the description of the degrees of "
"freedom have to be such that it is possible to gather the compatible "
"degrees of freedom between two neighbour elements in a generic way (for "
"instance connecting a Lagrange 2D element to another Lagrange 1D "
"element)."

"The principal dissatisfaction of this module is that description of the "
"degrees of freedom is not completely satisfactory. It is the principal "
"reason why one documentation on how to build an element from A to Z was "
"not made for the moment because description of the degrees of freedom was"
" conceived to be temporary. An effort of design is thus to be provided to"
" completely stabilize this module mainly thus with regard to the "
"description of degrees of freedom but also perhaps the description of "
"finite elements which could be partially externalized in a similar way to"
" the cubature methods , at least for the simplest finite elements "
"(equivalent and polynomial finite elements)."
