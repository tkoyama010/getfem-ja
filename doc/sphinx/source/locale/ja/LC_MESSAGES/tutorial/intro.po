"This tutorial is intended to present the main aspects of the |gf| library"
"  on commented simple examples. |gf| allows numerical modeling of complex"
" problems including coupled ones. It is relatively simple to add "
"arbitrary coupling terms thanks to a weak form description language. "
"Expressions in weak form are then compiled in the form of a list of "
"optimized instructions that are executed during assembly."

"|gf| is basically a library written in C++. However, it has an interface "
"that is available in Python, Scilab and Matlab  versions and allows to "
"use all the advanced features. It is recommended to start by using the "
"interface with scripting languages, which makes programming easier. The "
"three versions of the interface differ only by small syntax elements, "
"except for the graphics post-processing (Scilab and Matlab interfaces "
"offer the possibility of integrated post-processing while it is necessary"
" to use dedicated software such as Paraview, Mayavi or gmsh when using "
"the Python interface or directly the library in C++). The Python "
"interface is compiled by default along with the C++ library."

"Use |gf| interface is a good strategy even for complex applications, the "
"performance is comparable to the direct use of the C++ library and it is "
"more flexible to use. However, only the Python interface allows for the "
"parallelization (with MPI). The possible addition of functionality to the"
" interface being a relatively simple operation."
