"This guide provides a reference about the |Mlab| interface of |gf|. For a"
" complete  reference of |gf|, please report to the `specific guides`_, "
"but you should be able to use the |gfi|'s without any particular "
"knowledge of the |gf| internals, although a basic knowledge about Finite "
"Elements is required. This documentation is however not self contained. "
