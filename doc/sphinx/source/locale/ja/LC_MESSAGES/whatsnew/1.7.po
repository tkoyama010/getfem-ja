"Introduction of the `model brick` system, which provides a general "
"framework for the solution of common PDEs. Each brick is dedicated to a "
"specific task (i.e. \"handle Dirichlet conditions\", \"assembly of the "
"Stokes Problem\", \"solve a linear system\", etc.). These bricks are then"
" connected to each other. Examples of use can be found in the \"tests/\" "
"directory of getfem++."

"getfem-matlab has been renamed \"getfem-interface\" since it now provides"
" an interface for Matlab and `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ (with the "
"`Numarray <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray>`_ "
"package). Note that, while it is `documented "
"<http://getfem.org/python/index.html>`_ and working, the python interface"
" is still considered a *work in progress*. You have to enable it "
"explicitly with ``./configure --enable-python``. An interface to the "
"Gmm++ sparse matrices and solvers is also provided."
