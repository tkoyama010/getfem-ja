"This release is a transitional one until next version 5.0. The new high-"
"level generic assembly based on a weak form language is working and "
"usable. However, the basic model bricks still use the old generic "
"assembly and the new assembly is for the moment incompatible with a few "
"things (Nitsche bricks and time dispatcher bricks)."
