" new model bricks system. The old system is kept and compatibility with "
"3.x releases is globally ensured. However some functionalities are "

"The mesh_fem object has undergone significant changes. Now it is possible"
" to perform linear combination of degrees of freedom in order to describe"
" some special finite element spaces. The main application is to obtain a "
"finite element space reduced on a boundary or a curve. But it can be used"
" also to prescibe directly some matching condition. The main change in "
"the use of the mesh_fem object is the introduction of \"basic\" and "
"\"reduced\" dofs. See the documentation."

"A new algorithm gmm_range_basis allows to select a basis between the "

"Introduction of the new model brick system. The bricks are more simple to"
